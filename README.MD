>> <h3> Description </h3>
-------------------------

<p> 
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast, predictable performance with built-in scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a distributed database.
In this project we created a Harry Potter NoSQL database. They are fake data that can have 100 records. We created a Python script that transfers the files directly to the database, quickly and safely.</p>
